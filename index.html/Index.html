       <p><u>Grafting</u> is a means of propagating fruit trees where tissues from one plant are inserted into those of another so that they grow together as a single plant. It's commonly used in fruit tree cultivation, especially for varieties that don't grow well on their own roots or to combine the desirable traits of different plants. The part that's grafted onto the rootstock is called the scion, while the rooted plant providing the root system is called the stock. Grafting allows for the propagation of plants with specific traits, such as disease resistance, improved fruit quality, or better growth habits.
       <p>Grafting can also be used to change varieties of trees in your existing orchard.
